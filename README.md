This project demonstrates the implementation of the Apriori algorithm using Python. 
It focuses on extracting frequent itemsets and generating association rules from transactional data.

## Objective
- To apply the Apriori algorithm on sample transaction data.
- To extract frequent itemsets based on a minimum support threshold.
- To generate meaningful association rules with specified confidence and lift.

## Libraries Used

The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` – for data manipulation and preprocessing
- `mlxtend` – for the Apriori algorithm and association rule generation
- `numpy` – for numerical operations
- `warnings` – to suppress unnecessary warnings (optional)**
